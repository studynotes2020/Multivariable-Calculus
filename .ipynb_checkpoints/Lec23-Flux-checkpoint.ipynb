    "# Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "Flux is another kind of line integral. Given C plane curve, $\\vec F$ vector field, Flux of $\\vec F$ across C is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_c \\vec F \\cdot \\hat n\\ ds$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat n$ is unit normal vector to C, 90 clockwise from $\\hat T$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two normal vectors pointing different directions. We have to choose a convention. The convention is when we walk on the curve, the normal vector $\\hat n$ points towards right hand side\n",
    "\n",
    "If break C into small pieces, $\\Delta s$, then the flux will be the limit of s going zero, of the sum of vector field dot normal vector and multiply $\\Delta s$\n",

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "for $\\vec F$ a velocity field, flux measures how much fluid passes through C per unit time. Imagine fluids flow across curve C in unit time and C is chopped in small piece s\n",

    "Area = base x height = $\\Delta s \\times \\vec F \\cdot \\hat n$\n",

    "What flows across C from left to right is counted positively while right to left is counted negatively\n",

    "C is a circle of radius a at origin, counterclockwise\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec F = x\\hat i + y\\hat j$\n",
    "\n",
    "Along C, $\\vec F$ is parallel to $\\hat n$, $\\vec F \\cdot \\hat n = |\\vec F| = a$, if the radius of the circle is a\n",
