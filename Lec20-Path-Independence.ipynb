    "Special case: say $\\vec F = \\nabla f$ is gradient field. $f(x, y)$ is called potential. Then we can simplify evaluation of $\\int_c \\vec F \\cdot d\\vec r$\n",

    "\n",
    "where trajectory $c$ moves from $p_0$ to $p_1$. Or write it in another way\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_c f_x\\ dx + f_y\\ dy = \\int_c df = f(p_1) - f(p_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_c \\nabla f \\cdot d\\vec r = \\int_c f_x\\ dx + f_y\\ dy $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to parametrize $c$ into $x = x(t), y = y(t)$, then $dx = x'(t)\\ dt, dy = y'(t)\\ dt$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec F = \\langle y, x \\rangle = \\nabla f \\implies f(x,y) = xy$ because derivative f wrt x is y and f' wrt y is x\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can compute line integrals by finding the values of f at the endpoint. The motion starts from (0,0), $f(0,0) = 0$, then $c_1$ moves along x-axis, $f(1, 0) = 0$. So, there is no work, the potential doesn't change. \n",

You can't build something that is keep going, powered by that force because the force is not providing any energy.
