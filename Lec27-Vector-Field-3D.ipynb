    "\n",
    "P, Q, R are functions of x, y, z \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Example: Force fields (gravitational attraction of a solid mass at (0,0,0) on a mass m at (x,y,z))\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec F$ directed towards origin, magnitude will be order of $\\frac{c}{\\rho^2}$. $\\rho$ is the distance from the origin\n",

    "2. Another example is velocity fields $\\vec v$. Fluids flow. Wind in not the same at all altitudes\n",

    "In 3D, flux will be measured through a surface. Surface integrals\n",

    "We will be summing over all the pieces of a surface. In line integrals in the lane, we have two variables and reduce to one. For surface integral, we have three variables and reduce to two\n",

    "Cut the surface into many small pieces where each piece $\\Delta s$, take the dot product of vector field with unit normal vector. Then sum all the dot products\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Use geometry or setup $\\iint_S \\vec F \\cdot \\hat n\\ dS$\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Easy one. S is horizontal plane, $z = a$. $\\hat n = \\pm \\hat k, dS = dx\\ dy$\n",
    "\n",
    "For vertical plane parallel to yz plane, then $x = a$, $\\hat n = \\pm \\hat i, dS = dy\\ dz$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sphere of radius a from origin. $\\hat n = \\pm \\langle x,y,z \\rangle / a, dS = a^2\\sin\\phi\\ d\\phi\\ d\\theta$\n",
    "\n",
    "Advice: Do the dot product first, if see things are symmetry, turns to phi and theta\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cylinder of radius a centered at the z-axis. $\\hat n = \\pm \\frac{1}{a} \\langle x,y,0 \\rangle, dS = a \\ dz\\ d\\theta $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Graph $z = f(x,y)$ $\\hat n\\ dS =  \\pm \\langle -f_x, -f_y, 1 \\rangle dx\\ dy$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\pm \\langle -f_x, -f_y, 1 \\rangle$ is not $\\hat n$\n",
    "\n",
    "$dx\\ dy$ is not dS\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the is more complicated and the combination somehow simplifies nicely\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up bounds on $\\iint \\ dx\\ dy$ look at shadow of S in xy plane. Do this when z is eliminated\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geomtric interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\vec F$ is a velocity field, then the flux is the amount of matter through S per unit time\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the stuff flows through in a second?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the stuff lives in a small box whose base is that small piece of surface and 4 other sides are given by the vector field. The volume is base times height and the height is $\\vec F \\cdot n$"
